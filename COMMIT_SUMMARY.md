## 🔧 **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Reward Function Complete Overhaul (`mujoco_env.py`)**

#### **A. Replaced Organic Reward with Structured Phase-Based System**
```python
# OLD: Simple distance/angle rewards that allowed exploitation
# NEW: Explicit phase-based learning: ALIGN → APPROACH → GRASP

# ALIGN Phase (angles > 17.2°):
alignment_reward = 10.0 * np.exp(-2.0 * abs(dtheta)) - 0.5

# APPROACH Phase (angles ≤ 17.2°):  
proximity_reward = 20.0 / (1.0 + 10.0 * distance)
alignment_penalty = -5.0 * abs(dtheta)
forward_bonus = 5.0 * max(0, action[0])  # V2.2: Forward movement incentive
total_reward = proximity_reward + alignment_penalty + forward_bonus - 0.1
```

#### **B. Removed Hardcoded Action Restrictions**
```python
# REMOVED:
# action[2] = 0  # Arm disabled
# action[3] = action[3] / 2 - 0.5  # Claw restricted

# NOW: Agent has full control over all 4 actuators for complete learning
```

#### **C. Lenient Termination Conditions**
```python
# OLD: Terminated on facing wrong direction (>150°)
# NEW: Only terminate on: success, timeout, or completely lost (>2m)
return self._steps >= 1500 or objectGrabbed or is_too_far
```

#### **D. Enhanced Logging for Phase Tracking**
```python
# Added detailed phase-specific logging:
"Step X: APPROACH PHASE v2.2 - d=0.24, θ=-16.4° | proximity=5.91, forward_bonus=3.40, total=7.78"
```

### **2. Training Configuration Enhancements (`ppo_clawbot.py`)**

#### **A. High-Quality Training Parameters**
```python
# Enhanced for maximum training quality:
rollout_length = 4096  # Was: 2048 (2x longer for diverse experience)
update_epochs = 25     # Was: 10 (2.5x more for thorough optimization)
total_rollouts = 5000  # Was: 2000 (2.5x more for comprehensive training)
learning_rate = 1e-4   # Was: 3e-4 (3x lower for stable learning)
```

#### **B. Model Preservation System**
```python
# Preserve all completed models, only cleanup checkpoints:
cleanup_all_old_models(keep_count=3, model_pattern='ppo_clawbot_model_checkpoint_*.pth')
cleanup_all_old_models(keep_count=3, model_pattern='ppo_clawbot_model_interrupted_*.pth')
# *completed*.pth files are never deleted
```

#### **C. Updated Training Comments**
```python
# Reflects new structured learning approach:
# 🤖 UPDATED FOR STRUCTURED, SEQUENTIAL LEARNING (2025-09-24)
# ✅ GOAL: Systematically teach robot to Align → Approach → Grasp
# ✅ METHOD: Using phased reward function and curriculum learning
```

## 🚀 **Reward Function Evolution Tracking**

### **V2.0**: Binary phase system with strict 11.5° threshold
- **Result**: Robot stuck in ALIGN phase, never transitioned to APPROACH

### **V2.1**: Lenient threshold (17.2°) 
- **Result**: Reward inversion - robot learned to move away for better rewards

### **V2.2**: Forward movement incentive (CURRENT)
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Robot approaches targets, gets within 6.5 inches

---

## 🔍 **Critical Bugs Fixed**

### **1. Sim-to-Real Interface Bug**
- **Issue**: Distance units mismatch (inches vs meters) causing PPO saturation
- **Fix**: Proper unit conversion in real robot code: `distance_inches * 0.0254`

### **2. Action Space Understanding**
- **Discovery**: Simulation uses DIRECT motor control, not differential drive
- **Verification**: MuJoCo XML shows separate `motor_fl` and `motor_fr` actuators
- **Result**: Original motor mapping was correct; PPO learned coordinated wheel control

### **3. Reward Function Inversion**
- **Issue**: APPROACH phase gave lower rewards than ALIGN phase
- **Fix**: Added forward_bonus to make APPROACH phase more rewarding than moving away

| Metric | V2.0 | V2.1 | V2.2 |
