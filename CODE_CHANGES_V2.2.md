# Code Changes for V2.2 Implementation

## 📁 **File: `mujoco_env.py`**

### **🔄 Major Changes**

#### **1. Complete Reward Function Replacement (Lines 152-211)**
```python
# BEFORE: Organic reward function with distance/angle/progress/exploration bonuses
def reward(self, state, action, info=None):
    distance, dtheta, objectGrabbed = state
    proximity_reward = 10.0 / (1.0 + distance)
    alignment_reward = 5.0 * np.exp(-abs(dtheta))
    success_reward = 1000.0 if objectGrabbed else 0.0
    progress_bonus = 0.0 if self.last_distance is None else 20.0 * max(0, self.last_distance - distance)
    exploration_bonus = 0.5 * movement if movement > 0.1 else 0.0
    time_cost = -0.01
    return proximity_reward + alignment_reward + success_reward + progress_bonus + exploration_bonus + time_cost

# AFTER: Structured phase-based reward system
def reward(self, state, action, info=None):
    distance, dtheta, objectGrabbed = state
    ALIGNMENT_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # 17.2 degrees
    
    if objectGrabbed:
        return 1000.0
    
    if abs(dtheta) > ALIGNMENT_THRESHOLD:
        # ALIGN PHASE: Only reward alignment
        alignment_reward = 10.0 * np.exp(-2.0 * abs(dtheta))
        return alignment_reward - 0.5
    else:
        # APPROACH PHASE: Reward distance + forward movement
        proximity_reward = 20.0 / (1.0 + 10.0 * distance)
        alignment_penalty = -5.0 * abs(dtheta)
        forward_bonus = 5.0 * max(0, action[0])  # V2.2 addition
        return proximity_reward + alignment_penalty + forward_bonus - 0.1
```

#### **2. Removed Action Restrictions (Lines 311-313)**
```python
# BEFORE: Hardcoded restrictions
def step(self, action, time_duration=0.05):
    action[2] = 0  # Disable arm
    action[3] = action[3] / 2 - 0.5  # Restrict claw

# AFTER: Full agent control
def step(self, action, time_duration=0.05):
    # REMOVED: Hardcoded action restrictions - agent now has full control
    # The new structured reward function will teach proper arm and claw usage
```

#### **3. Lenient Termination Function (Lines 278-283)**
```python
# BEFORE: Terminated on wrong direction
def terminal(self, state, action):
    is_facing_completely_wrong = abs(dtheta) > (5 * np.pi / 6)  # 150°
    return self._steps >= 1500 or objectGrabbed or is_facing_completely_wrong or is_too_far

# AFTER: More lenient, lets reward function handle penalties
def terminal(self, state, action):
    is_too_far = distance > 2.0
    return self._steps >= 1500 or objectGrabbed or is_too_far
```

#### **4. Enhanced Curriculum System (Lines 215-272)**
- **Preserved existing curriculum**: Progressive difficulty from easy front positions to full random
- **Updated logging**: `get_curriculum_info()` shows current level in training logs

### **🔄 Major Changes**

#### **1. Enhanced Training Parameters (Lines 321-323)**
```python
# BEFORE: Standard parameters
rollout_length = 2048
update_epochs = 10
# Training loop: range(2000)

# AFTER: High-quality training parameters
rollout_length = 4096  # 2x longer for diverse experience
update_epochs = 25     # 2.5x more for thorough optimization
# Training loop: range(5000) - 2.5x more rollouts
```

#### **2. Optimized Learning Rate (Line 147)**
```python
# BEFORE: Higher exploration rate
self.lr = 3e-4

# AFTER: Stable learning rate
self.lr = 1e-4  # 3x lower for more stable and precise learning
```

#### **3. Model Preservation System (Lines 302-304, 446-447, 456-457)**
```python
# BEFORE: Cleaned up all model types
cleanup_all_old_models(keep_count=3, model_pattern='ppo_clawbot_model_*.pth')

# AFTER: Preserve completed models, only cleanup checkpoints/interrupted
cleanup_all_old_models(keep_count=3, model_pattern='ppo_clawbot_model_checkpoint_*.pth')
cleanup_all_old_models(keep_count=3, model_pattern='ppo_clawbot_model_interrupted_*.pth')
# *completed*.pth files never deleted
```

#### **4. Updated Documentation (Lines 5-19)**
```python
# BEFORE: "PURE REWARD TRAINING"
# 🤖 UPDATED FOR PURE REWARD TRAINING (2025-09-23):
# 🎯 NEW GOAL: Train model that learns to turn naturally without environment assistance

# AFTER: "STRUCTURED, SEQUENTIAL LEARNING"  
# 🤖 UPDATED FOR STRUCTURED, SEQUENTIAL LEARNING (2025-09-24):
# ✅ GOAL: Systematically teach the robot to Align → Approach → Grasp.
# ✅ METHOD: Using a phased reward function and curriculum learning.
```

#### **5. Enhanced Progress Reporting (Lines 342-347)**
```python
# NEW: Comprehensive training configuration display
print(f"🚀 Starting ENHANCED PPO training for maximum quality:")
print(f"   • Rollout length: {rollout_length} (2x longer for diverse experience)")
print(f"   • Update epochs: {update_epochs} (2.5x more for thorough learning)")
print(f"   • Total rollouts: 5000 (2.5x more for comprehensive training)")
print(f"   • Learning rate: {agent.lr} (3x lower for stable learning)")
print(f"   • Estimated training time: 8-12 hours for robust policy")
```
